This is the first thing I`ve done on python. Combined pretty complicated but i will improve myself to create more efficient code 

Tic-Tac-Toe

This are the requirements:

2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board
